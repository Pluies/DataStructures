Was ist das
===========

Short C implementations of data structures because I felt like it. A sort of programming kata if you will.

Conventions
===========

* No specific C style followed.
* Values stored in the data structures will be void\*, memory management of these shall be done by the calling program.
* Return values are EXIT\_SUCCESS and EXIT\_FAILURE

List of data structures
=======================

* Linked list: done
* Stack: done
* Queue: TODO
* Heap: TODO
* Tree: TODO
* Trie: TODO
